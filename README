# Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Setup Scripts

## Known issues

- Some Gnome Extensions like the Night-light Slider will have an issue after you install it via these scripts then update it from the Gnome Extension site ... the schemas folder is missing a .compile file that is fixed by running `glib-compile-schemas schemas` in the parent directory of the schemas directory
