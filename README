I was going to consider refreshing this and making sure things worked but we are so close to the 22.04 LTS i am going to archive this repo 

## Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Setup Scripts

### Known issues

- Some Gnome Extensions like the Night-light Slider will have an issue after you install it via these scripts then update it from the Gnome Extension site ... the schemas folder is missing a .compile file that is fixed by running `glib-compile-schemas schemas` in the parent directory of the schemas directory
